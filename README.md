# Portfolio_v2
Second iteration of portfolio website. Uses custom css instead of materialize

# Viewing the site locally
You'll need to run `http-server ./` to run the site locally. That way the carousel and other things will work. [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) is a simple and very configurable command line server.
